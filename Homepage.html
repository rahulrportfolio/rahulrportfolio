                <h3>IOS-app-Matrix-calculator</h3>
                <p>
                    Led a group of 4 in a <b>IOS app project</b>. Created a Gauss and Gauss Jordan matrix calculator using <b>Swift</b> and <b>SwiftUI</b> for the frontend GUI, 
                    and <b>C++</b> for the backend. <b>Objective C </b> was used to bridge <b>C++</b> and <b>Swift</b>. This app provides a simple way for users to interact with the <b>Gauss Jordan</b> and <b>Gauss</b> algorithm, 
                    allowing user to solve systems of linear equations. The Gauss Jordan method is commonly used in chemistry to equalize chemical reactions.

                <h3>What-To-Wear</h3>
                <p>   
                    A simple automated script, that runs on startup. Starting with <b>ZSHELL (zsh)</b> scripting Language, I coded a script that would communicate with Apple's iMessage to send a text message to any phone number that is provided to the script.
                    Then using an <b>API</b> from open-weather-map to gather temperature information. It sends 
                    a text message to the user stating what to wear based on the Temperature outside.
                    What's cool about this, is that you can have a file filled with phone numbers of family or friends who live in the same area.
                    The program would be able to send this message to each individual number.
